# Anything_Segment
 Detectron ipython using pre-trained models for instance and panoptic segmentation. Detectron2, a robust object detection and segmentation framework, emerges from the laboratories of Facebook AI Research.​  Harnessing the power of PyTorch, this open-source marvel offers a singular API catering to a plethora of tasks. But the thing is here you cannot segments in same colour. Becasue not segment using pixel values.
